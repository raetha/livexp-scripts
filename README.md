A series of scripts I wrote for the WinBuilder LiveXP project which created a WinPE like recovery image. That project is now defunct, but these scripts could be reference for someone trying to enable the same applications on newer WinPE projects.

All scripts are provided as is with no guarantee. Most scripts are for proprietary software and therefore do not have the applications embedded.
